# yaml2json-rs

yaml2json-rs converts one or more YAML documents into a JSON stream.

There are many implementations of this idea, with various limitations. This one aims for:
 - Speed
 - Multi-document support
 - Error control
     - selectively silence errors or output errors as JSON

This implementation relies heavily on the existing work in [Serde](https://github.com/serde-rs/serde), [yaml-rust](https://github.com/chyh1990/yaml-rust) and others to provide fast and correct serialization and deserialization. In na√Øve tests, this provided a significant speed improvement over other implementations, though your mileage may vary.

## Installation

Download pre-compiled binaries from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/Nessex/yaml2json-rs/releases/).

Or, install via `cargo`:
```
cargo install yaml2json-rs-bin --bin yaml2json
```

## Usage
```

    ./yaml2json --error=json file1.yaml | jq

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
