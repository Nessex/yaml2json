# yaml2json

yaml2json converts one or more YAML documents into a JSON stream.

There are many implementations of this idea, with various limitations. This one aims for:
 - Speed
 - Multi-document support
 - Error control
     - selectively silence errors or output errors as JSON

This implementation relies heavily on the existing work in [Serde](https://github.com/serde-rs/serde), [yaml-rust](https://github.com/chyh1990/yaml-rust) and others to provide fast and correct serialization and deserialization. In na√Øve tests, this provided a significant speed improvement over other implementations, though your mileage may vary.

## Installation
